# Stress level  
I've built a machine learning model using a Kaggle dataset and the CatBoostClassifier after evaluating multiple models. This specific model stood out as my selection after careful consideration.  
It's satisfying to have found a model that fits the dataset effectively.

# Features 
- Gender
- Age
- Occupation
- Sleep_duration
- Quality of sleep


# Folder structure:  
- images: This directory contains images used in your project.  
- data: This directory holds the dataset you utilized to create the machine learning model.  
- Models: Here, you've stored some models that were dumped from your source file, likely for future use in predictions in another application.  
- Src: This directory contains your source files. One of these files is used to create the entire machine learning model, while the other is likely for the Streamlit application, possibly for deploying or showcasing your model.

# Prediction:
- It will predict the stress level on the basis of given features.


# How to use:
1) git clone 'https://github.com/JAINAM576/Stress_Level/new/main?filename=README.md'  
2) cd Src  
3)  streamlit run .\Stress_predict.py  
4)  Fill the inputs.  
5)  Click on Submit.  

# What You Can Do Using This Repository ?  
- Enhance the existing model by adding more preprocessing steps or trying different algorithms.  
- Experiment with feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.  
- Explore alternative algorithms to find the best fit for your dataset.  
- Refine your model through thorough evaluation and validation processes.

# DISCLAIMER  
-  Please be aware that stress levels can vary significantly from person to person and can be influenced by various factors. While this content may include discussions about stress-inducing topics, it's essential to recognize your individual stress tolerance and seek additional support or professional advice if needed. If you find that your stress level is high or low, please don't solely rely on predictions. Consulting with a qualified expert or seeking support from trusted sources is recommended. Your well-being is paramount, so please prioritize self-care and take necessary steps to manage your stress effectively.
